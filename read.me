# Network Engineering Portfolio

This repository documents hands-on networking labs
implemented using physical Cisco routers, switches,
and a Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).

## Switching
- VLANs (access & trunk configuration)
- EtherChannel (L2 & L3 – LACP / PAgP)
- Rapid PVST+ (root bridge selection)
- HSRP (gateway redundancy)
- PortFast & BPDU Guard

## Routing
- Static routing (including default routes)
- OSPF (single-area & multi-area)
- IPv4 routing on Layer 3 switches
- IPv6 addressing & static routing

## Network Services
- DHCP (server & relay / ip helper-address)
- DNS (basic configuration & records)
- NTP (client configuration & authentication)
- SNMP
- Syslog
- NAT (static NAT & dynamic PAT)

## Security
- Standard & extended ACLs
- Layer 2 security
- Port Security
- DHCP Snooping
- Dynamic ARP Inspection
- Secure management using SSH

## Wireless
- Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)
- Trunking to WLC
- Dynamic interfaces
- WLAN configuration
- Lightweight AP (LWAP) association

## Lab Environment
- Cisco IOS routers and switches
- Multi-VLAN campus-style topology
- Redundant default gateway design
- Layer 2 & Layer 3 security controls
