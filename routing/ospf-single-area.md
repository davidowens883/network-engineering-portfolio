# OSPF Single-Area Routing

## Objective
Implement dynamic routing using OSPF
within a single area.

## Topology
- Routers in Area 0

## Key Configurations
- OSPF process
- Network statements

## Verification
- show ip ospf neighbor
- show ip route ospf

## Outcome
Routes dynamically exchanged and network
convergence achieved.
